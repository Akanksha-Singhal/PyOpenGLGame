# PyOpenGLGame
The project implements a game for catching falling raindrops using pyOpenGL and Pygame environment.
# Game description:
The game environment comprises of colourful raindrops falling in the river <br />
A horizontal bar is used to catch the falling raindrops.<br />
The bar can be moved upwards, left, right, downwards ( but above the level of the river)<br />
As soon as the drop hits the bar, score of the player increases by one. <br />
If the player misses to catch the raindrop and the raindrop falls into the river the river color changes to that of the raindrop that
just fell into it and the level of the river rises. <br />
There is a maximum height of the river after which the game finishes and the score is displayed .<br />
Therefore the player has to catch maximum raindrops before the river reaches its maximum level.<br />
